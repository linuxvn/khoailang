`Khoailang` is very popular in vietnam. One of the most popular things, even more than `golang`.

If you're going to have new startup in Vietnam, don't forget `khoailang`. It's a must.

Let's go: https://www.google.com/search?q=khoai+lang

```
// main.khoai

pkg main;

fn main() {
    println(“Hello, world!”);
}
```
